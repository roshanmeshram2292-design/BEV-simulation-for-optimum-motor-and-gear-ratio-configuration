# BEV-simulation-for-optimum-motor-and-gear-ratio-configuration
This MATLAB project focuses on optimizing traction motor configurations and gear ratios for electric vehicles. The simulation framework evaluates different motor-gear combinations to identify the optimum setup based on minimum energy consumption
# EV Motor-Gear Optimization Model

This project provides a MATLAB-based simulation framework that uses an **FMU block** to test three traction motor configurations with varying gear ratios. The gear ratio is swept from **5.0 to 15.0** in steps of **0.5**, and the framework determines the optimum motor-gear combination based on **minimum energy consumption** while satisfying performance targets.

## üöó Overview
Electric vehicle performance and efficiency are highly influenced by the motor-gear ratio combination. Selecting the right setup is essential for balancing:
- Energy consumption  
- Vehicle dynamics (acceleration, gradeability)  
- Top speed capability  

This model simulates multiple motor configurations through an FMU block and evaluates gear ratio variations to find the **most energy-efficient solution**.
